🚀 Tired of version issues when setting up React + Vite + React Router + Tailwind?

You're not alone! Many developers face setup problems as package versions keep changing. So, I created a starter template that’s already configured with:

✅ Vite
✅ React
✅ React Router
✅ Tailwind CSS
✅ PostCSS + Autoprefixer
✅ Daisy UI

No more wasting time on setup — just clone and code! 🧑‍💻🔥

# Process:

git clone https://github.com/nooraalam1/Frontend-Setup.git
cd Frontend-Setup
npm i
